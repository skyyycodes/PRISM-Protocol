              <p>
                Today, credit markets are structurally hard to trade. Risk is bundled, liquidity is fragmented, and price discovery is weak.
              </p>
              <BulletList items={marketProblems} />
              <p>
                If you want exposure, your choices are narrow:
              </p>
              <BulletList items={userChoices} />
              <p>
                There is no transparent, liquid, market-driven way to interact with credit. Most importantly, there is no clean way to trade credit risk directly.

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="PRISM" title="Build a market for risk itself.">
              <p>
                PRISM stands for Programmable Risk & Income Structured Markets. The core idea is simple: instead of building a separate market for every loan, PRISM builds markets for defined layers of risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most on-chain credit today looks like this: Loan A becomes Token A, Loan B becomes Token B, and Loan C becomes Token C. It sounds clean. In practice, it fails.
              </p>
              <BulletList items={loanFragmentation} />
              <p>
                PRISM takes a different path. A single vault can contain dozens or hundreds of borrowers, diversified across sectors and unified under one structure.

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="Tranches" title="Pool the credit. Separate the risk.">
              <p>
                Each pool is split into three deterministic financial layers, enforced on-chain. Yield flows top-down: Prime to Core to Alpha. Losses flow bottom-up: Alpha to Core to Prime.
              </p>

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="Tokens" title="Credit positions become liquid.">
              <p>
                Each tranche becomes a freely tradable token: pPRIME for safer yield, pCORE for balanced risk and return, and pALPHA for the highest upside with first-loss exposure.
              </p>
              <BulletList items={tokenClaims} />
              <p>
                For the first time, credit positions do not have to stay locked until maturity. Investors can:

              </p>
              <BulletList items={liveMarkets} />
              <p>
                Instead of holding a loan to maturity, you trade your exposure like any other asset. That creates a continuous, liquid market for credit risk.

            </ArticleSection>

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="Unlock" title="In PRISM, risk is the product.">
              <p>
                In traditional systems, risk is hidden inside products. In PRISM, risk is the product. You stop asking, "Which loan should I trust?" and start asking, "How much risk do I want to take?"
              </p>
              <p>
                CDOs and CLOs already use pooling, tranching, and waterfall distribution. But they are closed, opaque, and institution-only. PRISM brings that model on-chain and makes it open, transparent, composable, and liquid by default.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a loan defaults, the cascade is not theoretical. You watch it happen on Solana in seconds: Alpha wiped, Core cut, Prime protected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Losses do not disappear. They move.

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="Conclusion" title="The beginning of programmable credit markets.">
              <p>
                Credit is too important to remain opaque, illiquid, and inaccessible. It should be understandable, priceable, and tradable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, credit markets are opaque and illiquid. PRISM is how they become programmable, transparent, and tradable.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the beginning of programmable credit markets. And we are just getting started.
