                PRISM is built for real-world credit — businesses, invoice financiers, capital allocators who do not hold their wealth in USDC. They hold it in BTC. In ETH. In assets that predate Solana entirely.
              </p>
              <p>
                To underwrite credit against those assets, you need a way to lock them. Every path that existed before IKA ran through a centralized intermediary.

              <p>
                Custodial bridges do not solve the collateral problem. They move it — from an asset risk to a counterparty risk. A borrower who wraps BTC through a custodied bridge has not secured their collateral. They have loaned it.

              <p>
                IKA Network is a threshold Multi-Party Computation (MPC) network built on Sui. It enables a new primitive: dWallets. A dWallet is a cross-chain wallet whose private key is never assembled in one place.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of a single keyholder, the key is split across a decentralized node network using cryptographic secret sharing. Signing requires a threshold of nodes to cooperate — each contributes a key fragment, and the final signature emerges from their collective computation.
              </p>
              <BulletList items={ikaProperties} />
              <p>
                This is not a multi-sig. Multi-sig requires multiple keys that each exist independently. Threshold MPC means the key itself never exists as a whole — it is only ever expressed as a collective output. The cryptographic guarantees are stronger, the attack surface is smaller.

                The result: the Solana program has verified — without any off-chain trust assumption — that a borrower controls a specific quantity of BTC or ETH on its native chain. That verification is the basis for credit.

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="On-chain verification" title="The 81-byte attestation.">
              <p>
                IKA's oracle network produces an attestation when a dWallet's collateral balance crosses a threshold. This attestation encodes the dWallet ID, asset type, amount, and timestamp into a fixed 81-byte message, signed by the oracle set using Ed25519.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solana's Ed25519 precompile lets any program verify an Ed25519 signature as a native instruction. PRISM uses this directly: the first instruction in the collateral verification transaction runs the precompile check, and the second instruction — <span className="font-mono text-sm text-white/80">verify_ika_collateral</span> — reads the precompile's result through the instructions sysvar.
              </p>
              <p>
                The message layout in <span className="font-mono text-sm text-white/80">ika.ts</span> is byte-identical to what the Rust program expects. Any mismatch fails the instruction. There is no oracle trust assumption beyond IKA's network itself — the cryptographic proof does the work.

              </p>
            </ArticleSection>

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="Foundation" title="Encryption is infrastructure, not a feature.">
              <p>
                Threshold MPC is easy to describe as a security feature. But for PRISM, it is closer to what TCP/IP is for the internet: an infrastructure layer without which the application layer cannot exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                PRISM's credit market requires verifiable collateral. Verifiable collateral requires a way to lock assets without trusting any single party. Trusting any single party reintroduces counterparty risk — which is precisely what on-chain credit was supposed to eliminate.
              </p>
              <p>
                IKA's dWallets close that loop. The chain of trust from collateral to credit to loan disbursement is now end-to-end cryptographic. Not policy-based. Not custodian-based. Provable.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is what makes PRISM's credit market genuinely different — and why IKA was never optional. It was the prerequisite.
