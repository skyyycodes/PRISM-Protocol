                Crypto credit has experimented with several models, but each one misses the same primitive: a market for risk itself.

              <BulletList items={triedModels} />
              <p>
                Solana has fast execution, deep liquidity, and active users. What it lacks is a way to turn credit into a tradable asset.

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="PRISM" title="Tokenize risk, not individual loans.">
              <p>
                PRISM introduces programmable credit markets where risk is explicit, structured, and tradeable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of turning every loan into a separate token, PRISM pools credit, splits the pool into risk layers, and turns each layer into a token.

                These are not just labels. They are enforced on-chain through a deterministic waterfall for yield and a deterministic cascade for losses.

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="Market surface" title="Users should pick risk, not borrowers.">
              <p>
                Once risk layers are tradeable, the user experience changes. Users do not need to pick individual borrowers. They pick the risk level they want to hold.
              </p>
              <p>
                Markets can then:
              </p>
              <BulletList items={marketCanDo} />
              <p>
                Instead of holding loans to maturity, positions become dynamic, risk becomes adjustable, and capital becomes more efficient.
              </p>
            </ArticleSection>

            <ArticleSection eyebrow="Shift" title="Markets scale with abstraction.">
              <p>
                The old model is to tokenize loans. PRISM's model is to tokenize risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                That one shift changes everything, because markets do not scale with assets. They scale with abstraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Solana does not need more tokens. It needs better primitives. Credit is one of the largest markets in the world, and it still has not been rebuilt on-chain properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                PRISM is our attempt to fix that by making credit structured, transparent, and finally liquid.
