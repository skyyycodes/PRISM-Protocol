# PRISM Protocol — Master Index

**Project:** PRISM Protocol — full-stack on-chain credit infrastructure on Solana
**Submission target:** Solana Frontier Hackathon (Colosseum) — deadline May 11, 2026
**Status:** Design phase complete. Build phase starts April 26, 2026.

---

## The pitch in one line

> *"PRISM Protocol turns credit into programmable, tradable risk layers — with live loss simulation and real-time market pricing."*

---

## What we're building

A credit vault on Solana with three risk tranches (Senior / Mezzanine / Equity), a yield waterfall that distributes coupon income across them, a default cascade that absorbs losses bottom-up, an AMM for trading tranche tokens (`pPRIME` / `pCORE` / `pALPHA`), and a live dashboard showing all of it in real time.

Five hero features for the demo:

1. **Tranche Vault** — 3 SPL tokens, NAV-per-share accounting
2. **Live Yield Source** — pull-pattern waterfall distribution
3. **Secondary AMM** — constant-product swaps for tranche tokens
4. **Default + Loss Simulation** — the dramatic cascade (the demo's hero moment)
5. **Visual Dashboard** — animated NAV bars, event ticker, AMM price chart

Plus 6th feature: **Strategy presets** (Safe / Balanced / Aggressive) for one-click allocation.

## Stack (locked)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Smart contracts | **Anchor** (Rust) |
| Chain | **Solana Devnet** (mainnet target Phase 1.5) |
| Frontend | **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind** |
| Wallet | **Solana Wallet Adapter** (Phantom / Backpack) |
| SDK | **`@solana/web3.js` + `@coral-xyz/anchor`** |
| Tokens | **Classic SPL tokens** for tranches |
| Two programs | `prism_core` (credit engine) + `prism_amm` (market layer) — separated for blast-radius isolation |

---

## Side track strategy (locked — one build, multiple prize pools)

| Priority | Track | Prize ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | **Encrypt + Ika** | $10K (RFP literally describes credit infra) |
| Secondary | **Cloak** | $5K (batch disbursement = waterfall payout) |
| Free-roll | **Dune SIM** | $6K plan (analytics dashboard) |
| India regional | **Dodo Payments** | $5K (if Day 14 has slack) |
| Default | **Frontier main pool** | $30K Grand + $10K × 20 |

**Explicitly skipped:** Eitherway, Tether QVAC, Torque, Zerion, MagicBlock, SNS, La Familia, Umbra (overlaps with Cloak).

## Locked decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **NAV-per-share model** for tranches | Clean waterfall logic, secondary market trivial, dramatic demo visuals |
| 2 | **Single loan, parameterized seed** for demo | Simplicity; design narrative supports N |
| 3 | **Default trigger:** admin button + Switchboard oracle | Admin = fast demo; oracle = pitch credibility |
| 4 | **Classic SPL tokens** for tranches | Cloak handles privacy at cash-flow layer |
| 5 | **Per-tranche-asset** loss math (not per-share) | Matches NAV model, avoids precision bugs |
| 6 | **Separate AMM Anchor program** | AMM bug ≠ vault failure; modular pitch |
| 7 | **Q64.64 fixed-point** for NAV; 6-decimal USDC | Avoids rounding loss in waterfall |
| 8 | **Admin-simulated borrower** in v1 | Iterate without integration blocker; Ika dWallet plug-in for v2 |
| 9 | **Pull pattern** for `accrue_yield` | Visible borrower→vault USDC flow in one tx |
| 10 | **Admin-only LP** for AMM in MVP | Saves UI work; "permissionless in production" pitch line |
| 11 | **Tokenless through Phase 2** | Clarity > optionality; insurance backstop possibly at Phase 3 |
| 12 | **Demo length: 2:30 max** | Faster = sharper; default cascade gets the longest segment (40s) |
| 13 | **Demo flow:** Setup → Deposit → Yield → Trade #1 → DEFAULT → Trade #2 → Withdraw | Dual-trade structure proves "markets understand risk" |

## Critical rules (do not break)

1. **Tier 1 must work perfectly** — deposit, yield waterfall, default cascade. If these fail, you lose
2. **Day 5 is a hard checkpoint** — Tier 1 working in CLI/script form, even without UI. Safety net for recording
3. **IDL sync after every contract change** — `anchor build && anchor idl parse` and commit
4. **Demo recording deadline: Day 15** — Day 16 is for submitting only
5. **Don't drop a higher tier for a lower one** — strategy presets never come before NAV math working

## Day 1 starts April 26, 2026

The design phase is complete. Time to build.
