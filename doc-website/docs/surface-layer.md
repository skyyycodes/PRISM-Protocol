# Surface Layer

The Surface Layer is the user-facing interface for PRISM.

It does not define financial truth. It reads protocol state, explains it clearly, and helps users make decisions based on risk preference.

## Dashboard

The dashboard displays:

- NAV per tranche.
- Vault allocation.
- User positions.
- Profit and loss.
- AMM market price.
- Difference between NAV and market price.
- Credit event history.
- Loss cascade visualization.

## Strategy Interface

PRISM can expose strategy presets for users who do not want to manually choose tranche weights.

Example presets:

| Strategy | Allocation Bias | User Intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | Prime-heavy | Lower-risk exposure |
| Balanced | Prime + Core | Mixed yield and protection |
| Aggressive | Alpha-heavy | Higher-risk residual upside |

These presets are interface-level tools. They do not change the underlying protocol rules.

## Position Readout

For each user position, the Surface Layer should show:

- Token balance.
- Current NAV redemption value.
- Estimated AMM exit value.
- Unrealized gain or loss.
- Exposure to future losses.
- Position in the capital stack.

## Demo Experience

The main PRISM demo should make the financial mechanics visible:

1. Deposit into a tranche.
2. Accrue yield.
3. Observe waterfall distribution.
4. Trigger default.
5. Watch the loss cascade.
6. Observe AMM repricing.
7. Withdraw or trade.

The goal is not only to show transactions. The goal is to show credit risk becoming legible.
